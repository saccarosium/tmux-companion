== Acknowledgment

This script was inspired originally inspired by ThePrimeagen's https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/master/bin/.local/scripts/tmux-sessionizer[tmux-sessionizer], but since the shell scripting foo of ThePrimeagen is very lacking, and the man continue to push a broken script, I've decided to publish my improved version, first conceptualized in this https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/pull/16[PR] (was my first PR on Github didn't know how to use git).
